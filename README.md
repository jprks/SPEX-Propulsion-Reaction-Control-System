# SPEX Standard - Project Design Document
This is an RIT Space Exploration Standard defining guidelines for content and formatting of project design documents (PDDs).

## When should I use this template?
This document is intended for a member of RIT Space Exploration to bring forward an idea for a project to be conducted under the RIT SPEX banner.

## How do I use this template?
Replace the text in this document with your own information and generate a PDF document by using a LaTeX compiler. For a brief user's guide on using this template and setting up LaTeX on your computer, check [this repository's Wiki](https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/SPEX-Standard-Proposal/wiki).

## Why use LaTeX instead of a regular word processor?
LaTeX is not a word processor. It allows you to write content without worrying about formatting or typesetting -- LaTeX handles all the organization, placement of text, spacing, headings, and so on. It is the de facto standard for technical and scientific documents, and it is beneficial for you to be at least somewhat familiar with using it, especially if you plan to do research in the future.

## The template is broken or missing something important!

# What's the purpose of a Project Design Document?
The intent of a Project Design Document (PDD) is to organize and document a project idea and its objectives. In the ideal project life cycle, an idea undergoes an initial research phase where a project _Champion_ and their small team develops the primary objectives and requirements. The PDD is a snapshot of the known challenges, risks, and anticipated areas for research at the very start of a project.

## Who should propose a project?
The Champion is the primary author of the design document and, similar to a Principal Investigator, leads a preliminary team in developing a project idea. The Champion is not necessarily the project manager for a project they propose. Faculty recommendations, advice, and support for a project is not necessary but is strongly encouraged. The Champion is the main point of contact for the PDD. The project's Champion be handed off over time, but a project must always have a Champion.

## Will my PDD be rejected?
PDDs are not approved nor rejected. PDDs are archived, so a design document that doesn't initially take off may be picked up by a new team somewhere down the line.

## Is my design document binding?
In the ideal project life cycle, a PDD defines a set of objectives or deliverables which are fulfilled and discussed in a final report or paper. In practice, this is not always the case but an PDD should guide a project such that "feature creep" is avoided and good science is achieved.
